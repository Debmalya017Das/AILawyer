            The Petitioner states that from the month of <span class="__15__" ><input type="text" name="__15__"></span>, the Respondent began to ill-treat the Petitioner, and from the month of <span class="__15__" ><input type="text" name="__15__"></span>, began to physically assault the Petitioner without any cause whatsoever. For some time, the Petitioner made no complaint and underwent such ill-treatment, hoping that the Defendant would see better sense. However, on or about <span class="__16__" ><input type="text" name="__16__"></span> month of <span class="__17__" ><input type="text" name="__17__"></span>, the Respondent attacked the Petitioner with a stick and inflicted serious injuries leading to multiple fractures in the hand and leg of the Petitioner.

        <li>
            The petitioner says that even thereafter, the Respondent continued to treat the Petitioner in a cruel and violent manner.
